# E-Voting Dapp


This project presents a decentralized electronic voting application implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The system leverages Solidity for smart contract development and utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js) to facilitate a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionality.

<b>Ethereum</b> is an open-source, public blockchain platform enabling decentralized computing through smart contracts. This facilitates the creation and execution of dApps with diverse functionalities.


## About the Dapp


This e-Voting DApp leverages the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate secure and transparent elections. It features two primary user roles:

Administrator: The administrator is responsible for creating elections and adding candidate information to the Ethereum blockchain.

Voter: Voters interact with the DApp to select an election and cast their vote for a preferred candidate.

This decentralized approach ensures that votes are recorded immutably on the blockchain, eliminating the risk of manipulation or fraud.
