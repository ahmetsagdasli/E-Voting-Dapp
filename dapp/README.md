This project was set up with Create React App.

## Available Scripts: 
Within the project directory, you can execute:

## npm start: 
Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test: 
Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />
Refer to the running tests section for more details.

## npm run build: 
Creates a production build of the app in the build folder.<br />
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for maximum performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Refer to the deployment section for further details.

## npm run eject: 
Note: this is irreversible. Once you eject, you cannot revert!

If you are unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration options, you can eject anytime. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands, except eject, will still function, but they will now refer to the copied scripts so you can modify them. From this point, you are on your own.

Using eject is optional. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel pressured to use it. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when needed.
